            <p class="text_center">The Final Improved String pHarser (FISH) has been made during Open Summer of Code 2021,
                this project is dedicated to split a scientific reference into its relevant components and return the result as a downloadable json file.
                The current features available include: parsing a single reference, parsing a file of references (see "example data" on <a href="https://github.com/osoc21/Final-Improved-String-pHarser/tree/master/app/example%20data">our github</a> for valid formats),
                and extracting references from a pdf.
                These features are based on already available open source projects and integrate/combine functionalities of these alternatives.
                The first two features are mainly build with the code of <a href="https://anystyle.io/">Anystyle.io</a>, which provides one of the best services.
                Instead of using their default model, the model behind FISH is trained on data provided by the flemish marine institute, consisting of around 2000 example
                references with no fixed format, going back to the mid 18th century. For the last service, reading references from pdf, <a href="https://grobid.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">Grobid</a> is used.
                Although they do not allow manual training, their service is high quality and well documented.
